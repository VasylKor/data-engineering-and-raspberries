# Raspberries and Data Engineering

## Overview and Objective
Having more than one Rapberry Pi, it is sad not using them in Data Engineering to try and learn things regarding:
- Linux
- Networking
- Clustering
- Scaling/fault tolerant resources

among those DE specific.

Keeping in mind that Cloud computing providers already give us ready to use products, I would like to "deep dive" into concepts overlooked by who begins its career working solely with such providers.
Pipelines will be designed for specific technology/tool/feature, somewhat putting aside bigger loads cases (not really supported by Pi's hardware).

## Contents
Every folder here contains a different project. I will try to mantain consistency in subfolder structure between projects.
